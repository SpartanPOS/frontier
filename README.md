# Spartan POS Blockly

Spartan POS is a modular point of sale. Programmable using Google Blockly, or through SDK. 

*Update 9/2/2022: As of this moment this is very minimal, and only able to make blocks from JSON in local storage. I plan to implement the code generators next.*

## Build

This is a react project.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
